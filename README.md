# multi_cauchy
A quick exploration of fitting variable field magnetization data of nanoparticle and molecular magnets to a sum of an arbitrary number of Cauchy distributions.

There's a [demo with lots of markdown explanations](/tests/demo_w_md.ipynb) and a [bare demo](/tests/demo.ipynb) containing examples of how to use the code. The parsing code should be able to handle M vs H files from [Quantum Design MPMS3 magnetometers](/tests/sample_files).
